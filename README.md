Gatys_torch

A simple implementation of "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style", by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker and Matthias Bethge

The paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf

This tutorial was followed: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html

This implementation also inputs a total variation loss as Gatys et al. did, which was not implemented in the tutorial.
