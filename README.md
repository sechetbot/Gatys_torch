Gatys_torch

A simple implementation of "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style", by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker and Matthias Bethge

The paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf

This tutorial was followed: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html

This implementation also inputs a total variation loss as Gatys et al. did, which was not implemented in the tutorial.

Some images to try out are included in the "Images" folder, with the results without hyperparameter tuning in the "Results" folder.

I hope you may find this useful, and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any ideas for improvement, or if you just want to show me the image you produced!
